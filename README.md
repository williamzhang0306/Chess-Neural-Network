Thanks for checking out my chess project repo! 

## Summary
In this project I trained a feed-forward neural network to generate centi-pawn evaluations of chess positions, similar to engines like Stockfish.

## How to play against my neural network
You can play my engine on your local machine by running otb-chess/OTB.py.

You can also use this link https://lichess.org/?user=BillyTheBot#friend . Eventually this will let you create a challenge on Lichess against my chess engine. I'm still working on hosting my engine on Google Cloud.
