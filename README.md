# Chess-Neural-Network

Thanks for checking out my chess project repoistory! 

In this project I experimented with using neural networks to generate centi-pawn evaluations of chess positions, similar to evaluation functions used in conventional chess engines like Stockfish.

I combined the evaluation networks I trained with a negamax search function I wrote last year to create my own chess engine. To see the code for the engine itself checkout play-chess/EngineClasses.py

Some of the files in data/ and keras-exports/ are too large to be hosted on Github, so there are placeholder.txt files instead while I try to find a solution.

If you would like to contact me please send an email to williamzhang@utexas.edu
